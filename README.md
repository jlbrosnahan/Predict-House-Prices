* Complete analysis can be viewed in RPubs at https://rpubs.com/brosnahj/Boston-House-Predictions
* Complete analysis can also be viewed in Predict-House-Prices.md file above

## Background
We have been asked to investigate the Boston House Price dataset. Each record in the database describes a Boston suburb or town. 

## Business Problem
Can a model be built to predict house prices in Boston Area with 80% accuracy level?

## Data Description
The data was drawn from the Boston Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area (SMSA) in 1970 from UCI Machine Learning Library.

## Machine Learning Skills
* Comprehensive univariate and multivariate plots
* Linear algorithms: linear regression, logistic regression
* Non-linear algorithms: Support Vector Machines (radial basis), CART, KNN
* Ensemble algorithms: Stochastic Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, Cubist
* Resample accuracy comparison and plots
* Model tuning, grid search
* Business problem solved

## Summary
House prices can be predicted with 90% accuracy using top Cubist tuned algorithm. The error rate of our top model is plus or minus $3.2 thousand. Business objective has been achieved.
